    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Kard is a South Korean co-ed group formed by DSP Media. They officially debuted on July 19, 2017, with their
        extended play Hola Hola.The group's name is an abbreviation of different "cards" that are assigned to each
        member: BM is assigned as the "King" card, J.Seph is known as the "Ace" card, Somin is given the "Black JokeR"
        card, while member Jiwoo is referred to as the "Color JokeR" card.

        KARD's brand of K-pop has been described as "undeniably trendy", with their discography focusing on contemporary
        house and dancehall vibes, which Billboard has referred to as something that is "pulled directly from Top 40
        charts". The group's musical style diverges from electropop, hip hop, EDM, and alt-R&B that was known to have
        been trending in the American music market by the time of their pre-debut.
